# Temperature-Converters-Website
This is my Amex/DI Bootcamp Project: Simple Temperature Calculators 
First project combining JS, CSS, and HTML by myself.

Directions for the project:


The site will have three web pages:

A home page containing a few paragraphs of lipsum orum text describing the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales
A page with a calculator that converts Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius
A page with a calculator that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit
Use some CSS to make them look at least slightly attractive, however the majority of your energy should go to making the site functional.
Add a small banner and a Bootstrap navbar to all three pages that will allow navigation between them and give them a consistent look-and-feel.

On each of your calculator pages, design them with a place for an input temperature, a convert button, and a place to put the output (converted) temperature. 

Test your pages.

Add an HTML reset button to each calculator form. (Note:  HTML reset buttons in forms do not require you to write any JavaScript code if all they are doing is clearing input fields.)

Make all Git commits
